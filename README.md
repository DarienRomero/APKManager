<h2 align="center">APK Manager</h2>

APK Manager is an application that allows you to control client access to the versions of your applications in a similar way to TestFlight on iOS. (Only available for Android)

## Features üåü

- üîê Authentication with email and password
- üí° Full access control per user and group of apps
- üîî Push notifications segmented by channels

## Setup

***Flutter version: 3.7.11***

#### Firebase configuration

Create a Firebase project and enable the authentication and firestore modules. Additionally, enable rules to allow reading and writing as needed.

Modify the package name and use it to create the Android application.

For image urls you can use Firestore Storage or the storage service of your choice.

For new version push notification consider that channel name is the same as firestore app document uuid.

To create a user you must first create the user on Firebase authenticated. The given uuid must be the same for the document uuid of the 'user' collection.
